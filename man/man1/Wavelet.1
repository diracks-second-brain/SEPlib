       nt,n1  - integer
           dimension of time axis parameter n1wavelet = n1out also output to
           header

       nx,n2  -integer
           [1] number of input traces to use (see wavelet=data)

       np,n3  -integer
           [1]  number of input planes to use (see wavelet=data)

       dt     -real
           [.004] sample rate (parameter d1wavelet = d1out also output to
           header)

       domain -char*
           [time]  domain option: time,ctime,frequency,spectrum time      = nt
           real values representing the wavelet ctime     = nt complex values
           representing the wavelet frequency = nt/2+1 complex values repre-
           senting frequency domain wavelet spectrum  = nt+2 real values,
           first half are normalized
                       spectrum, second half are normalized phase
                       angle which is the phase angle divided by
                       pi. Usually used for quick check plots.  (parameter
           domainwavelet = domain also output to header)

       wavelet  -char*
           [spike]  type of wavelet spike   = spike in time domain equals
           white spectrum bandpass= butterworth bandpass filter, sharpness of
                      frequency cutoffs is controlled by the order ricker0 =
           gaussian curve ricker1 = first derivative of gaussian curve ricker2
           = second derivative of gaussian curve data    = amplitude spectrum
           is average of
                     nx*np input traces from the in file zero    = null
           wavelet (ie: all zeroes)

       phase -char*
           [none]      phase options: none,minimum,degrees none    = no modi-
           fication of phase minimum = minimum phase min2zero = minimum to
           zero phase conversion degrees = numerical value representing
           degrees of
                     constant phase shift from specified wavelet

       fund -real
           [40]     fundamental frequency of ricker wavelet
                    (actually relates to gaussian half-width) =item  flow
           -real

           [10]   low  cutoff frequency of butterworth filter

       fhigh -real
           [60]   high cutoff frequency of butterworth filter

       order-integer
           [1]    order of butterworth filter
                  (1 is average sharpness, > 1 is sharper, < 1 is smoother)
                  (sets both high and low frequency cutoffs)

       orderlow-integer
           [1] low  cut order of butterworth filter (overrides order)

       orderhigh-integer
           [1] high cut order of butterworth filter (overrides order)

       tdelay - real
           additional time delay

       bell -real
           [nt/4*dt]    bell window half width, < dt/2 for no bell window

       boxcar -integer
           [pnt*dt]    boxcar window width
