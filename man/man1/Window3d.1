       f_ - int
                 first element to keep along axis specified by a number replacing the '_'.

       j_ - int
                  sampling of the elements to keep along the specified axis.

       n_ - int
                  number of elements to keep along the specified axis.

       min_ - float
                  Minimum sample value to grab from specified axis.

       max_ - float
                  Maximum sample value to grab from specified axis.

       synch - int
                  [0]whether or not to sink

       Window3d <in.H min1=0.3 max1=0.5 j2=3 f2=2 >out.H

          Creates out.H, which is in.H windowed from 0.3 to 0.5 along the 1 axis, and
          includes only every 3rd sample along the 2 axis, starting with the 2nd.
          Assuming that the first axis is time (in seconds), and the second axis is offset,
          out.H will contain times from 0.3 to 0.5 seconds, and every third trace begining
          with trace number 2.
