       tape    -file
                  input tape device or seg-y filename (see notes)

       verbose  - int
                 [0] silent, 1= echo every vblock traces

       vblock  - int
                 [50]   echo every vblock traces whtn verbose option set

       buff  -  int
              1            for buffered device (9-track reel tape drive)

              0 possibly useful for 8mm EXABYTE drive

       conv  -  int
                   1 convert       =0 don't convert to IBM format

       create_reel  - int
             [0] whether (1) or not(0) to create header rather than read from disk

       hfile - file
                   hfile=header    ebcdic card image header file

       bfile  -  file
                   bfile=binary    binary header file

       trmin  -  int
             1 first trace to write

       trmax  -  int
             INT_MAX  last trace to write

       endian - int
            [1] 0 for little-endian machines (PC's, DEC,etc...)

       errmax - int
              0    allowable number of consecutive tape IO errors

       format - int
                           override value of format in binary header file

       nsamp_max   - int
                  By default each trace is assumed to be SU_NFLTS (1,000,000+)
                  in size and a copy of that length is done for each trace.
                  Set this to something more reasonalbe (2000) for a massive speed up.

        Note: The header files may be created with  'segyhdrs'.

        Note: For buff=1 (default) tape is accessed with 'write', for buff=0

               tape is accessed with fwrite. Try the default setting of buff=1

        for all tape types.

        Caveat: may be slow on an 8mm streaming (EXABYTE) tapedrive

        Warning: segyread or segywrite to 8mm tape is fragile. Allow time

                  between successive reads and writes.

        Precaution: make sure tapedrive is set to read/write variable blocksize

                  tapefiles.
