       Gain program with first arrival detection

CCOOMMMMEENNTTSS
               Agc gains seismic traces by normalizing each sample by the
               power of a window of samples surrounding that point.

               When the detect= is set to 1, agc is not applied on a trace
               until a first arrival is detected. The first arrival is
               detected when a moving dwind exceeds an initial dwind by a
               threshold factor.

               Agc < in.H window=200 detect=1 dwind=10 thresh=25. > out.H

               Applies agc on a trace based on a trace window of 200 samples.
               Agc is only applied after the first arrival has been detected
               using a detection window of 10 samples. The detection of the
               first arrival is based on an amplitude change between consecutive
               detection windows of 25%.
