       H1x- float
               [1.96961558] component of the HALF-offset vector for in.H

       H1y- float
               [0.347296387] the other component of HALF-offset for in.H

       H2x- float;
           !$    [1.55884564] component of the HALF-offset vector for out.H

       H2y- float
               [0.899999976] the other component of HALF-offset for out.H

       t_min_log- float
              [0.04] minimum cutoff time for logstretch. Must be >0 !

       fk_filter- logical
               [y] indicates whether fk filtering is desired

       v_min- float
               [2.] minimum apparent velocity of events (for the fk filter)

               Units should correspond to the distance units in in.H

       f_max- float
               [100.] maximum frequency (Hz) present in the data (for logstretch
                antialiasing)

       NOTE: This AMO implementation is discussed in detail in 'Effective
                         AMO implementation in the log-stretch, frequency-wavenumber

                        domain', by Ioan Vlad and Biondo Biondi, Report SEP-110,

                         Aug. 2001, pp. 63-71

       NOTE: The code uses OpenMP parallelization, it detects the number
                   of threads itself.

       NOTE: The program has been tried with 0<t_min_log<o1, but it should
                         work for any t_min_log>0, and any o1>=0 for in.H
