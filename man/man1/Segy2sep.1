       bfile   -file
                  [tape.binary]  file to store binary block
                  specify full paths to ease conversion back to segy

       ns      -int
                  [bh.hns]  number of samples (use if bhed ns wrong)

       trmin   -int
                  [1]    first trace to read

       trmax   -int
                  [INT_MAX]  last trace to read

       errmax  -int
                  [0]  allowable number of consecutive tape IO errors

       nmem-int
                  [100] how many traces to look for non zero header keys

       nkeep-  -int
                  number of keys we will force to be transfered

       keep_   -char*
                  name of the key to keep (size of nkeep)

       keeplist-char*
                  name of keys to keep (separated by :)

       nextra_keys  -int
                  number of extra keys not in SEG-Y standard

       extra_name_  -char*
                  name of extra key

       extra_type_  -char*
                  type of extra key (int, unsigned int, short, unsigned
                  short, long, unsigned long, float, double)

       extra_offset -int*
                  index of extra key (0-238)

       nignore -int
                  number of keys to ignore when converting

       ignore_ -char*
                  name of the key to ignore (size of nignore)

       ignorelist-char*
                  list, separated by :, of keys to ignore

       dump_all     -int
                  [0], 1-dump all keys

       only_list    -int
                  [0], dump only keys listed by keep and extra

       ns           -int
                 number of samples in the dataset

       format       -int
                 [5]  Float data

       ntraces     - int
                  If you want to pipe out  provide the number
                  of traces in the dataset, otherwise unpipable.

       nsamp_max   - int
                  By default each trace is assumed to be SU_NFLTS (1,000,000+)
                  in size and a copy of that length is done for each trace.
                  Set this to something more reasonalbe (2000) for a massive speed up.

          Notes: Traditionally tape=/dev/rmt0.   However, in the modern world
          tape device names are much less uniform.  The magic name can
          often be deduced by 'ls /dev'.  Likely man pages with the
          names of the tape devices are: 'mt', 'sd' 'st'.  Also
          try 'man -k scsi', ' man mt', etc.  Sometimes 'mt status'
          will tell the device name.

          For a seg-y diskfile use tape=filename.
          Remark: a seg-y file is not the same as an su file.
          A seg-y file consists of three parts: an ebcdic header,
          a binary reel header, and the traces.  The traces are (usually)
          in 32 bit IBM floating point format.  An SU file consists only
          of the trace portion written in the native binary floats.

            type:    sudoc segyread   for further information

         ARRAY(INVALID)=(/ns,delrt,d1,f1,f2,d1,d2/)
