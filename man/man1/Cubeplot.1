       movie      - int
                 0 output is single cube plot
                 1 output is movie over 1 axis
                 2 output is movie over 2 axis
                 3 output is movie over 3 axis

       nframe-  int
                 number of frames in movie

       dframe-  float
                 increment between input frames for movie (must be positive)

       frame1-    int
                 frame numbers for cube faces that display

       frame2-  int
                 a single frame. For faces that display a movie,

       frame3-  int
                 this is the starting frame number.

       center- int
                 [0] default the frames to the center of the cube

       point1- float
                 front face of cube takes up this fraction of 1 axis

       point2- float
                 front face of cube takes up this fraction of 2 axis

       flat - char
                 if flat=y, the three faces are displayed flat rather
                 that in a perspective view.

       wantcoordlabel- int
                 By default (wantcoordlabel=1), lines are drawn to
                 indicate where in the cube the three slices are taken
                 from, and the coordinate values of the three cube
                 slices shown are plotted. If you want the frame numbers
                 instead of the coordinates, specify wantcoordlabel=0.
                 If you want lines to be drawn with no labeling,
                 specify -1. For no lines to be drawn specify -2.

       wantaxes  - char
                 Axes are drawn by default. Specify wantaxes=n to skip them.

       wantoutline    - char
                 By default, lines are drawn to outline each face of the
                 cube. Specify wantoutline=n to override.

       n1pix      - int
                 number of pixels on 1 axis of vplot raster
                 default is 2*n1. Using fewer reduces memory requirements,
                 but makes a coarser image.

       n2pix     -  int
                 number of pixels on 2 axis of vplot raster
                 default is 2*n2.

       popup -  char
                 Specifying popup=y brings up an xtpanel
                 (if you have xtpanel
                 installed) with three sliders. Moving these sliders changes
                 the frames plotted on the three cube faces. If you pipe
                 the output of Cubeplot to 'Xtpen cachepipe=n' you will see
                 the display update as the sliders are moved.
                 You can specify your own xtpanel script file by doing
                 popup_file=filename.

       wantscalebar - char
                  [0] (0,1,n,y) turns on scale bar

       bartype      - char
                  [h]  (v)   horizontaly or verticaly aligned bar

       barwidth     - float
                  [.4]     (inches)

       barreverse   - int
                  [0]   (0,1,n,y)  reverse the scale

       barlabel     - char
                  label for the scale bar

       screenht - float
                 [10.24] sets screen height

       screenwd - float
                 [13.75] sets screen width

       screenratio-float
                 [.75] sets screen height to width ratio

       xinch,yinch  -    float
                 [10.24],[7.5]

       crowd,crowd1,crowd2  - float
                 [.75][crowd1=crowd][crowd2=crowd]
                 (.75< crowd < 1.) crowds labels off the screen
                 by expanding data on 1 or 2 axis.

       xll,yll,xur,yur - int
                 sets Lower Left and Upper Right coordinates

       wheretitle- char
                 [t] (t,b,l,r) where to put title (top, bottom, left, right)

       titlefat -int
                 [0] makes the title fat

       title - char*
                 title for plot

       titlesz - int
                 [10] font size for title

       backcol - float*
                 [0,0,0] background color (R,G,B) between 0 and 1

       fillcol - float*
                 [backcol] fill color (R,G,B) between 0 and 1

       color  - char*
                 [I] (esize=1) or  color=332(esize=3)(triplets) color table

       polarity- int
                 [1] white is high by default

       nreserve - int
                 [8] number of colors to reserve

       movish - char
                 [n] if y,halves the color table like movie does (0,1 n,y)

       hurry - char
                 [1]   (0,1 n,y)

CCOOMMMMEENNTTSS
           color= one of {I,i,F,R,W,G,T} just like in Movie. You may also append
           a 'C' to make clipped values show up Red (ie color=IC is like color=I
           but with clipped values flagged). You will need to have nreserve at least
           3 for this option to work, since you have to leave the normal vplot 'Red'
           (vplot default color 2) as a possibility.
           If color=T, colfile= should give the name of a color-table file (just
           like Movie).  Optionally, you may also specify a color of the format RGB,
           (ie color=332) where each of R,G, and B is the integer number of bits
           to allot to that primary. This is meant for esize=3, but it also makes
           funky color tables when esize=1.
