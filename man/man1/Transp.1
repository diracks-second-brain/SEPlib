       Transp- transposes a SEPlib dataset in the plane specified.

         The reshape option allows for transposes that can't be
         strictly described by a plane. For example if you
         want to change 1,2,3,4,5 to 5,3,4,1,2 this is really
         a transpose of a cube where axes 1 and 2 are combined
         and axes 3 and 4 are combined. To do this transpose
         operation you would specify plane=13 and reshape=2,4,5
