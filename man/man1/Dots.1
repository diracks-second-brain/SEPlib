       Plots a data plane, like 'Wiggle,' but lollipops on strings.  Adapts
       default data format to values of n1,n2.  Can put a separate label on
       each trace.  (see labels=) Data area fills screen when title= label1=
       labels= are undefined.

CCOOMMMMEENNTTSS
       A program somewhat like Wiggle, but better in some ways because it
       tries to be smarter. The output style depends on the input n1 and n2.
       For loosely packed traces with only a few data points Dots plots the
       data as lollipops on strings, showing each data point clearly. There
       are also options for separately labeling each trace, omitting dead
       traces, making bar graphs, etc. As n1 and n2 increase Dots by default
       simplifies the output and eventually behaves almost the same as Wiggle.
       Unfortunately Dots does not use the axis drawing and plotting routines
       shared by Wiggle, Contour, Graph and Ta2vplot, and so Dots' options and
       ouput plot size, position, and axes are currently incompatible with
       those for other plot programs.

       seemean-int
                 [1] draw axes lines (=0 means don't)
                 0  default not to when n2>30 to avoid clutter

                 [1]  draw strings from axis to balloons
                 0  default not to when n1>400 since too slow

                 [1] draw the balloons
                 0 default not to when n1>130 since dots are small
                 2 draw dots only where signal is not zero.

                 1 trace separation depends on max abs value.

       seedead -  int
                 0 plot dead traces as zero traces or don't plot them.

       radius  - float
                 radius of the dot to be plotted. Defaults to
