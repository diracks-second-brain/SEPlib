       Header   - files
                   seplib history header files to merge.

       axis     - int
                   [3]  axis number to merge (1,2,3)

       space    - char
                   [y] leave space between merged data to make it easy to tell
                       where one file ends and the next begins in merged movies
                       default: space=y for Merge, space=n for Cat

       nspace   - int
                   number of traces in the space
                   (defaults to something reasonable).

       n1       - int
                   if n1=-1 this means that the data is simply read
                   until EOF for each file; this is like using 'cat' on
                   the individual data files. Note n1=-1 implies axis=3 space=n

       Merge seplib header and data file to stdout. Merge is a modified ver-
       sion of Cat (the same code, but with a perl script on the front end to
       fix some problems). Scat is the same thing.

           Note, a header provided on stdin will be used. This was not true
           in previous versions. I.e. this will work!
           Myprog <data.H | Merge axis=2 data2.H > out.H
