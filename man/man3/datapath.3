       Datapath outputs an intelligent prefix character string that can be
       used to generate output file names.  This prefix is generated according
       to the following priorities:

CCOOMMMMEENNTTSS
       1) Look for datapath= on the command line.

       2) Look for the environmental variable DATAPATH

       3) Look for datapath= in a file named `.datapath' in the current direc-
       tory.

       4) Look for datapath= in a file named `.datapath' in the user's home
       directory.

       5) Use the default datapath `DEFAULT_DATA_DIR/login_name/' .
       DEFAULT_DATA_DIR dir is defined when seplib is compiled. The default
       value is often "/scr".

       A ".datapath" file has the following format. An entry consists of an
       (optional) host name followed by datapath=path, where path is the data-
       path you wish to use. If you wish to place files in a directory you
       should terminate the path component with a /.  The first entry should
       contain no hostname, it is the default datapath for all hosts. If an
       entry is founds with a hostname that matches the initial part of the
       current hostname (without the domainname) then that datapath will be
       used instead.

       e.g.  datapath=/scr/dave/ oas datapath=/scr4/dave/ robson datap-
       ath=/scrx/dave

       This will result in a datapath of "/scr/dave/" except on machines oas
       and robson.

       If a datapath starts with a $ (e.g. datapath=$SCR/dave/ ) then the
       value of the environment variable will be used to start the datapath.
       See "output" for a description of how environment variables are handled
       in the information written to the header file.

       The value returned by datapath is the address of the input string.

       Datapath terminates program execution with an appropriate error message
       if it has trouble reading a .datapath file.

       The long list of rules is not easily remembered.  It is an attempt,
       however, to mimic standard UNIX conventions such as  csh  or ex use to
       establish defaults.
